How to make maggi?

Its very easy, first take 1 cup of water (or how much ever soupy you want it to be), thenboil it for 3-5 minutes, thirdly, put the maggi in it, and then shortly you have to put the magic masala, and stir it for 10 mins. 

And there you have it, tasty maggie just for you!

Enjoy!
